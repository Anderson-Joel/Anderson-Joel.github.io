                <p>I'm Joel Anderson for CIT 261. In this is my Reflexion Journal. </p>
                <p>This is my second time taking this class. Since the first time taking taking it, I didn't do so well. It was my professionalism in that class that really hit me the most on my grade for that class. Mostly because I'd like to have a little bit of structure in my learning experience. Because it was so different than what I was so used to, I stressed out a lot. But this time around, I taking what I learned from that last class and apply to this class. I was more prepared this time. Because of that I was able to have a better understanding of well a little understanding coding. I'm able to read the coding, I have a hard time trying to write it out. Because of that, I stress out on the writing it out instead of the reading. well mostly because I do have autism. Most of this class wasn't that structured I do stress out on some of the most littlest things. Just kind of like what's happening right now. Since I went through this again, I got I was able to read my coding a little better, update some of the coding that I kept after my last class, change some of the names for the in the code, and be having a better understanding of looking other at other peoples code. I was able to do a little better but whenever it came closer to the end of the week and I wanted to try to get a C grade, I just could not get close to what I wanted to get and could not understand what was is needed for what others are looking for.</p>
                <p>Every week, I was kind of in charge of recording meetings for our group. Making sure that we all met and to make sure what was going on. I didn't have that many questions and I still had a bit of understanding of what was being taught.  I don't consider coding one of my most strong points, I know that it's very important to have that while out in the CIT field. I don't consider myself the best but, I try to do the best of my abilities with what needs to be done.
                <p>I hope that I get my get something done from this or at lease try to pass this class with what I've learned. If not that I know I'm trying my best </p>
